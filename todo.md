1. Draw an orbit for asteroid
2. Scale the asteroid according to earth
3. Scale the earth accroding to decided units?
4. Show interactive timeline, which will allow user to move asteroid through time?
5. Show close approach situations on orbit.
6. Add ability to tweak orbit eccentricity to simulate intersection with earth.

MAIN TODOS:
1.Visualize trajectory(orbit) of asteroid (with interactivity)
2.Predict impact scenario on 2d map
3.Explore possible mitigation strategies (explosions, nukes etc)
